<p>We notice that a large part of the people surveyed were coming from Europe (approx. 78%), followed by people coming from Asia (approx. 8%), North and Central America (approx. 8%), South America (approx. 3%) Australia and Oceania (approx. 2%) and finally Africa (approx. 1%). Again, these results were concerning the whole canton.</p>
<p><strong>Global percentage of people coming in canton of Vaud per country of origin</strong></p>
<p>We have then decided to explore the distribution, in frequency and percentage, of the nationalities per continent. You will find here again a table and a graph, summarizing this information:</p>

<p>For visibility purpose, we have decided to represent here in the graph the top 7 countries of the table, representing all above 3% of the nationalities found in the survey. We have then decided to group the remaining countries in the category “Other Countries”.</p>
<p>We notice that Switzerland is the nationality the most represented among all the visitor (approx. 31.5%). Therefore, there are a lot of Swiss citizens travelling in their own country for various purpose to the canton of Vaud. Also, we see again that the most represented nationalities are Europeans, such as France (approx. 14.5%), United Kingdom (appox. 7.5%), Germany (approx. 5.5%), Belgium (approx. 3.5%) and finally Spain (approx. 3%). The only other nationality coming from a other continent represented here is the United States of America (approx. 5.5%). Proximity could be for instance one of the main factor explaining these results.</p>
<p><strong>Per city, the percentage of each visitor’s country of origin, relative to the number of visitor of the city</strong></p>
<p>Then, In order to know more about the precise destination of the visitors, we have decided to gather by city the percentage of country of origin.</p>

<p>The percentage here was in fact a ratio representing the number of people from one particular nationality over the total number of visitors in each city. Unfortunately, as very few data has been collected in some cities, the ratio of visitor from one nationality over all the visitor surveyed can be really large (up to 1, in point of percentage). On the other hand, as data from some other city gathered a lot of answers, we observe that some country of origin (e.g.&nbsp;Austria in Lausanne) were only accounting for 0.2% of the total visitors.</p>
<p><strong>Ratio of each country of origin relatively to the number of tourist surveyed in each district</strong></p>
<p>In the same process, let’s now explore the country of origin ratio per district of tourism.</p>

<p>Again, the low number of data available in our data don’t allow us to get really satisfying results for every city surveyed.</p>
<p>As Swiss citizens accounted for more than 30% of the visitors surveyed, we have decided to know more about the percentages of people coming from Switzerland, visiting Switzerland. Therefore, here is the distribution of visitors per canton of origin.</p>

<p>From this plot, we can see that the most pupular city in the canton of Vaud is Lausanne. Let’s now have a look at the type of accommodation where the visitor stayed in the canton of Vaud. We took the liberty to remove the 46 observation where the type of accommodation was not specified. We can now concentrate more our attention on the district where the people stayed.</p>

<p>As we can see on the graph above, the best average is optain in Ouest lausannois with an average of 4 stars. But this statistics is not very representative to the reality. Only 13 people answered the survey in this district which is not enough to have a good idea of the quality of the hotels in this district. The second best region after Ouest lausannois is Riviera-Pays-d’Enhaut with an average of 3.66 stars. This district got with 623 observation which is more representative. This high score for the Region of Riviera-Pays-d’Enhaut is not really surprising given the fact that this place is well know for its luxury hotels.</p>

<p>With these plots, we can clearly observe that there is a difference in spendings for people who travelled with a package compared to the ones travelling without a spending package. Overall, the main expenses of people with a package is the package itself, meaning that most of the other variables are already included in the package. On the other hand, without the package, it is interesting to see that the main spending is on the overnight stay, then the food &amp; drinks and finally the souvenirs.</p>
