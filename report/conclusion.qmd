# Conclusion

## Results

Through this report, we managed to make the survey data stand out using graphs and plots. Additionally, we observed connections among multiple factors within responses, which is difficult to see with raw data alone. An interesting aspect of the survey was the diversity of the questions asked to individual respondents, which enabled us to display links between factors.

However, our analysis was constrained by the relatively small dataset of 2,487 rows. Consequently, when we examine particular demographics, such as regional origins, in our research, our findings lack certainty due to the small number of people we studied, which makes it hard to determine if our findings are statistically significant or merely random occurrences.

## Recommendations to Vaud Promotion

Looking at the observed results, have found several recommendations that we could propose to Vaud Promotion in order to better target their promotion to travelers coming to Vaud.

To begin with, despite only 8% of surveyed travelers having purchased a package, the primary targets for the packages are people from Asia, followed by Africa and South America. These groups are more willing to spend on packages, which include additional expense categories. Additionally, travelers who purchase packages tend to spend the least on other expenses.

Next, Americans are the highest spenders when it comes to individual expenses. They tend to spend significantly across all categories and throughout the whole canton of Vaud. Most spending occurs in the Riviera-Pays-d'Enhaut district, averaging 2'500 CHF per person, followed by Lausanne at 2'300 CHF. Other regions see spending between 1'500 and 2'000 CHF. Therefore, if the company wants to propose packages, Riviera-Pays-d'Enhaut could be an ideal target due to the high spending in this district.

Examining the seasonality of travelers, most respondents visit in March and July, which is logical since July is summer. Additionally, if the company wants to promote a specific district for winter, Aigle is the most frequented during that season, notably for winter outdoors activities such as skiing.

Next, we can focus on the groups. 68% of travelers to Vaud are accompanied by their partners, indicating that Vaud is a good region to promote to couples. Regarding expenses, solo travelers spend more on average per person than families or groups, with respective spending of 3'300 CHF for solo travelers, 2'700 CHF for families, and 2'200 CHF for friend groups.

Regarding destinations and accommodations, the majority of travelers spend only one night in Vaud. The most popular accommodations are hotels, followed by stays with relatives or friends, and rented apartments such as Airbnb. Overall, travelers typically spend between 10% to 25% of their entire trip in Switzerland.

Finally, examining the origins of the travelers, 72% of the Swiss tourists coming to Vaud are Swiss-German, 24% are Swiss-French, and only 4% are residents of Vaud visiting as tourists. Among Swiss-German tourists, most come from Uri relative to its population. Additionally, 60% of visitors to the Jura-Nord Vaudois district are Swiss-German, while 28% of visitors to Aigle are from the French-speaking part of Switzerland.


## Improvements for future works

After finishing the project, we identified points for improvement in some aspects of the survey. We will provide some suggestions for improvement for future projects with the company.

To begin with, obtaining more data would be beneficial for better representation of travelers' origins. This approach would allow us to identify specific regions of origin rather than just countries. It's challenging to prove statistical significance with a low number of respondents. Therefore, surveys need to be conducted uniformly across various times and locations.

Additionally, it would be useful to include aspects such as the date of the response and the respondent's birth date or age to enable more detailed analyses. Open-ended questions can be tricky to analyze, as some respondents misunderstood the questions or made mistakes, complicating the analysis. To avoid outliers in spending, it would be helpful to provide a range of prices for respondents to select from instead of allowing free responses, as some people answered in their own currency instead of CHF, which skewed the data. Finally, offering more details on what is included in the travel packages would be beneficial.
