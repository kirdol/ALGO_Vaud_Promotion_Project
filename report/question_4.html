<p>As we can see, out of the 67 city surveyed in the 10 district, the most popular district is Lausanne. This is not really suprising because of the way the data was collected. More people were surveyed in these city/districts than other smaller one. It is still interesting to have a look to keep this in mind.</p>

<p>As we can see on the graph above, the best average is optain in Ouest lausannois with an average of 4 stars. But this statistics is not very representative to the reality. Only 13 people answered the survey in this district which is not enough to have a good idea of the quality of the hotels in this district. The second best region after Ouest lausannois is Riviera-Pays-d’Enhaut with an average of 3.66 stars. This district got with 623 observation which is more representative. This high score for the Region of Riviera-Pays-d’Enhaut is not really surprising given the fact that this place is well know for its luxury hotels.</p>
